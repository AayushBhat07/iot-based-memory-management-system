# IoT-Based Memory Management System for Photographers

## Overview

The **IoT-Based Memory Management System** is designed specifically for photographers to streamline event photo storage and retrieval. It enables photographers to upload event photos to a secure database, while users can easily find their pictures using an AI-powered face-matching system.

## Built With

- Next.js  
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- AI Face Recognition  

## Features

✅ **Effortless Photo Uploading** – Photographers can upload entire event albums in one go.  <br/>
✅ **Secure Cloud Storage** – All photos are stored safely in a database for future access.  <br/>
✅ **AI-Powered Face Matching** – Users can find their photos by uploading a reference image.  <br/>
✅ **Automated Sorting** – The system quickly scans and retrieves matching images.  <br/>
✅ **Responsive Web Interface** – Users can access their photos from any device.  <br/>

## 🛠 How It Works<br/>

1. **Photo Upload by Photographers:**  <br/>
   - After an event, photographers upload all captured images to the platform.  <br/>
   - The system organizes and securely stores them in a database.  <br/>

2. **User Photo Search:**  <br/>
   - Users visit the website and upload a reference photo of themselves.  <br/>
   - The AI-powered face-matching system scans the database for similar images.  <br/>

3. **Instant Photo Retrieval:**  <br/>
   - The system displays all matching images for the user to view and download. <br/> 
   - Users can refine their search if needed for better accuracy.  <br/>

4. **Download & Share:**  <br/>
   - Users can save their photos directly or share them through the platform.  <br/>
